## 🤔 Which badge addon should I use?

A few other projects have been written to display badges in Storybook. This addon is a rewrite of [storybook-addon-badges](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@geometricpanda/storybook-addon-badges) from [Jim Drury](https://github.com/geometricpanda), focused on exploiting Storybook [tags](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/tags). We use tags as a data source to display badges, rather than dedicated [story parameters](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/parameters), as tags are becoming more prevalent in Storybook and have a strong role overlap with badges.

This architectural choice opens up new possibilities, but also prevents some features from the original addon from working. The table below summarises the differences between both addons.

## 🏁 Default Config

This addon comes with a default config, allowing you to get started immediately by adding tags to your content.

### Preconfigured Badges

|                            Preview | Tag patterns                          | Suggested use                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------: | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|        ![](./static/badge-new.png) | `new`                                 | Recently added components or props/features                                                                        |
|       ![](./static/badge-beta.png) | `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, `experimental` | Warn that a component or prop is not stable yet                                                                    |
| ![](./static/badge-deprecated.png) | `deprecated`                          | Components or props that should be avoided in new code                                                             |
|   ![](./static/badge-outdated.png) | `outdated`                            | Components with design changes that weren't yet implemented, which can incur extra development costs to your users |
|     ![](./static/badge-danger.png) | `danger`                              | Components that require particular attention when configuring them (e.g. for with security concerns)               |
|  ![](./static/badge-code-only.png) | `code-only`                           | Components that only exist in code, and not in design                                                              |
|    ![](./static/badge-version.png) | `version:*`                           | Per-component versioning                                                                                           |

### Display Logic

By default, all tags are always displayed on the toolbar, but they're only displayed in the sidebar for component entries, and for docs or story entries that appear at the top-level. They are not displayed in docs or story entries inside a component or group entry.

Besides, the addon is limited to one badge per entry in the sidebar. Badges placed first in the configuration will be displayed in priority. For example, the `new` badge will be displayed before the `code-only` badge.

## 👀 Usage

To display preconfigured badges, add the relevant tags to your components, stories, or docs entries.

### Component Badges

To set badges for a component (and its child stories), define `tags` in the component's meta:

```ts
// src/components/Button.stories.ts
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'
import { Button } from './Button'

const meta: Meta<typeof Button> = {
  title: 'Example/Button',
  component: Button,
  tags: ['autodocs', 'version:1.0.0', 'new'],
}
```

### Story Badges

To add badges to a specific story, add `tags` to the story object itself:

```ts
// src/components/Button.stories.ts
export const Tertiary: StoryObj<typeof Button> = {
  args: {
    variant: 'tertiary',
    size: 'md',
  },
  tags: ['experimental'],
}
```

### Docs Badges

To set badges for a docs entry, pass a `tags` array to the [`docs` parameter](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/parameters):

```ts
// src/components/Button.stories.ts
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'
import { Button } from './Button'

const meta: Meta<typeof Button> = {
  title: 'Example/Button',
  component: Button,
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      tags: ['outdated'],
    },
  },
}
```

## 🛠️ Customise Badge Config

In your manager file, you may redefine the config object used to map tags to badges. Each tag is only rendered once, with the first badge configuration it matches; therefore, make sure to place your overrides to the config first if you also want to keep the default config in place.

```ts
// .storybook/manager.ts
import { addons } from '@storybook/manager-api'
import {
  defaultConfig,
  type TagBadgeParameters,
} from 'storybook-addon-tag-badges'

addons.setConfig({
  tagBadges: [
    // Add an entry that matches 'frog' and displays a cool badge in the sidebar only
    {
      tags: 'frog',
      badge: {
        text: 'Frog 🐸',
        bgColor: '#001c13',
        fgColor: '#e0eb0b',
        tooltip: 'This component can catch flies!',
      },
      display: {
        sidebar: ['component'],
        toolbar: false,
      },
    },
    // Place the default config after your custom matchers.
    ...defaultConfig,
  ] satisfies TagBadgeParameters,
})
```

Let's now walk through the different properties of `tagBadges`. Each object in `tagBadges` represents a list of tags to match, and where a match is found, a badge configuration to use and places where the badge should be displayed.

### Tags

The `tags` property defines the tag patterns for which a badge will be displayed. It can be a single pattern or an array of patterns.

A tag pattern can be:

| Pattern type                   | Description                                | Example pattern        | Match outcome      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| `string`                       | Exact match                                | `'new'`                | `'new'`            |
| `RegExp`                       | Regular Expression                         | `/v\d+\d+\d+/`         | `'v1.0.0'`         |
| `{ prefix: string \| RegExp }` | Match part of a tag before a `:` separator | `{ prefix: 'status' }` | `'status:done'`    |
| `{ prefix: string \| RegExp }` | Match part of a tag after a `:` separator  | `{ suffix: 'a11y' }`   | `'compliant:a11y'` |

---

### Display

The `display` property controls where and for what type of content the badges are rendered. It has two sub-properties: `sidebar` and `toolbar`. In the sidebar, tags may be displayed for component, group, docs or story entries. In the toolbar, they may be set for docs or story entries (as other entry types aren't displayable outside the sidebar).

The following entry types are rendered by Storybook:

| Icon                              | Name      | Description                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](./static/entry-story.svg)     | story     | One of the component stories written in your CSF files.                    |
| ![](./static/entry-docs.svg)      | docs      | A documentation page generated through MDX files or autodocs.              |
| ![](./static/entry-component.svg) | component | The grouping of a component's stories and autodocs page.                   |
| ![](./static/entry-group.svg)     | group     | A generic group containing unattached MDX docs, stories and/or components. |

To control where badges are shown, you pass conditions to the `sidebar` and `toolbar` keys. You can either specify a single condition, or an array of conditions (in which case matching any condition causes the badge to display).

Conditions can either specify the type of entry you want to display badges for, or, whether to allow badges for any tag that isn't already displayed by a parent entry (e.g. in the top-level component in the sidebar). Tags inherited from parents are skipped in the default configuration; otherwise, every single story would have a tag when you add tags to a CSF meta export, which would be verbose.

A condition takes two properties in its full form:

| Property        | Description                                                                                          | Type     | Example value |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `type`          | The type of entry to match                                                                           | `string` | `'docs'`      |
| `skipInherited` | Whether to skip showing the badge if a parent entry in the UI already shows a badge for the same tag | `string` | `true`        |

Syntax shortcuts are supported, and summarised in the table below:

| Type            | Description                                                       | Example  | Sidebar outcome                                                                                                   | Toolbar outcome                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `ø` _(not set)_ | Use default behaviour                                             |          | `[{ skipInherited: true }, { type: 'component', skipInherited: false }, { type: 'group', skipInherited: false }]` | `[{ type: 'docs' }, { type: 'story' }]` |
| `false`         | Never display badge                                               | `false`  | `[]`                                                                                                              | `[]`                                    |
| `true`          | Display badge everywhere                                          | `true`   | `[{ skipInherited: false }]`                                                                                      | `[{ type: 'docs' }, { type: 'story' }]` |
| `string`        | Display only for one type of entry, and skip inherited tag badges | `'docs'` | `[{ type: 'docs', skipInherited: true }]`                                                                         | `[{ type: 'docs' }]`                    |

### Badge

The `badge` property defines the appearance and content of the badge to display. It can be either a static object or a function that dynamically generates the badge based on the matched content and tag.

#### Static Badge Object

The object has the following properties:

| Name            | Type                             | Description                                    | Example                                                                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **text**        | `string`                         | The text displayed in the badge (required).    | 'New'                                                                                             |
| **bgColor**     | `string?`                        | The CSS property passed to `background-color`. | '#aea'                                                                                            |
| **fgColor**     | `string?`                        | The CSS property passed to `color`.            | '#2f2'                                                                                            |
| **borderColor** | `string?`                        | A border colour, rendered as a CSS box-shadow. | '#2f2'                                                                                            |
| **tooltip**     | `string \| TooltipMessageProps?` | A tooltip shown on click in the toolbar only.  | `'This component is new!'` or `{ title: 'New Component', desc: 'Recently added to the library' }` |


#### Dynamic Badge Functions

Dynamic badge functions allow you to customize the badge based on the current entry and matched tag. They must return a valid badge object as documented above. They receive an object parameter with the following properties:

- `entry`: The current HashEntry (component, story, etc.), with an `id` and/or `name`, a `type`, and `tags`
- `getTagParts`, `getTagPrefix`, `getTagSuffix`: Utility functions to extract parts of the tag
- `tag`: The matched tag string

Example of a dynamic badge function:

```ts
// .storybook/manager.ts
import { addons } from '@storybook/manager-api'
import {
  defaultConfig,
  type TagBadgeParameters,
} from 'storybook-addon-tag-badges'

addons.setConfig({
  tagBadges: [
    {
      tags: { prefix: 'version' },
      badge: ({ entry, getTagSuffix, tag }) => {

### Tooltip

Badges may have a tooltip when displayed in the toolbar. The tooltip is disabled in the sidebar to avoid conflicting with the sidebar's function, though feedback is welcome on this.

You may pass a string to tooltips for a simple tooltip. You may also pass the same objects used by [Storybook's `TooltipMessage`](https://5ccbc373887ca40020446347-idzavsdems.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/tooltip-tooltipmessage--docs):

* `title`: The title of the tooltip *[string]*
* `desc`: Secondary text for the tooltip *[string]*
* `links`: An optional array of link objects displayed as buttons *[object[]]*
  * `title`: The title of the link
  * `href`: The URL to which the link points (navigates in-place)
  * `onClick`: A callback when the link is clicked (can be used to navigate in a new browser tab)

## Sidebar Config

This addon uses the [sidebar `renderLabel` feature](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configure/user-interface/sidebar-and-urls) to display badges in the sidebar. If you define it for other purposes in your Storybook instance, it will conflict with this addon and sidebar badges won't show.

To show badges for items that aren't customised by your own `renderLabel` logic, you may import the addon's own `renderLabel` function and call it at the end of your function.

```tsx
// .storybook/manager.ts
import { addons } from '@storybook/manager-api'
import type { API_HashEntry } from '@storybook/types'
import { renderLabel, Sidebar } from 'storybook-addon-tag-badges'

addons.setConfig({
  sidebar: {
    renderLabel: (item: API_HashEntry) => {
      // Customise your own items, with no badge support.
      if (item.name === 'Support') {
        return '🛟 Get Support'
      }

      // Customise items with badge support by wrapping in Sidebar.
      if (item.type === 'docs') {
        return <Sidebar item={item}>{item.name} [doc]</Sidebar>
      }

      // Badges for every item not customised by you.
      return renderLabel(item)
    },
  }
})
```

Likewise, if you define configuration for the `sidebar` option without including `renderLabel`, the render function defined by this addon will be overwritten, and badges won't show in the sidebar. Import and add the `renderLabel` function like so:

```tsx
// .storybook/manager.ts
import { addons } from '@storybook/manager-api'
import { renderLabel } from 'storybook-addon-tag-badges'

addons.setConfig({
  sidebar: {
    /* your own changes here... */
    renderLabel,
  }
})
```


## 📝 Workflow Examples

This repository contains examples on how to support various workflows with Storybook badges:

- Market segmentation
- Separating functional from branded components
- Compliance state for checks like a11y, brand, QA
- Component composition patterns
- Use of external dependencies
- Smart components

To see these in action, check out the repository and run the local Storybook instance:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sidnioulz/storybook-addon-tag-badges.git
cd storybook-addon-tag-badges
pnpm i
pnpm start
```

## 🐌 Limitations

### Per-Story Config

This addon does not support changing the badge config for a specific story, and never will. This is because parts of the Storybook UI, like the sidebar, are rendered in a context where story data is not loaded. Storybook has stopped preloading all story data in v7, to improve performance.

As a result, we need to create sidebar tags without access to story-specific data. This addon uses the [core addon API](https://storybook.js.org/docs/addons/addons-api#core-addon-api) to read your configuration, and so the way to customise the rendering of a specific badge is to use [dynamic badge functions](<(#dynamic-badge-functions)>). Those functions can exploit a story's ID, title, or tag content to customise the rendered badge, as examples below will show.

### Component Tags

In Storybook, your MDX and CSF files are converted to `docs`, `component`, `group` and `story` entries to render the sidebar, each with their own semantics. `docs` and `story` entries directly inherit the tags defined in `parameters.docs.tags` and in the [CSF `meta`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/csf#default-export), respectively.

For `component` entries, tags are computed indirectly: they are the intersection of tags present on all of the component's stories. For example, for a component that defines the tag `version:1.2.0` in its `meta`, and has one story that defines an additional tag `deprecated`, the component entry will only have the `version:1.2.0` tag defined.

In particular, if a component `meta` defines two tags `outdated` and `version:1.1.0`, but one story explicitly removes the tag `outdated` (by adding `!outdated`), then the component entry will only have tag `version:1.1.0`.
